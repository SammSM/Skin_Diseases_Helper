# Skin Diseases Helper  

**Skin Diseases Helper** is an Android application that predicts possible skin diseases from photos using a trained neural network.  
The project combines three main parts:  

- 📱 **Android mobile app** – user-friendly interface for uploading or capturing photos  
- ⚙️ **Backend (FastAPI)** – handles requests and runs the trained model  
- 🤖 **Neural network** – built and trained in Python (Jupyter Notebook) for skin disease prediction  

This project demonstrates how **machine learning models** can be integrated into **mobile applications** through a lightweight backend API.
